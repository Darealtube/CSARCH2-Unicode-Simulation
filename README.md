# Unicode to UTF Converter 

The application is a simple converter of UTF 8, UTF 16 and UTF32 from Unicode, which was made with a graphical user interface to make it visually appealing to the users. The application was made through HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## How to Use: 
1. Input a Unicode in HEX value 
    * For example, if you want to get the utf equivalent of "@", instead of typing itself, you will have to type the hex value of it which is 40.
2. Once done, click "Convert". Results of UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 will appear afterwards 
3. (Optional) If you want to copy the result to your clipboard and paste it somewhere, click "Copy Result to Clipboard"
